# My Advent of Code Solutions. 
This repo will track my solutions for every year of advent of code.  
As of now, I plan to implement all the solutions in Rust :crab: to practice and become more comfortable with the language.  
## File Structure. 
Each year's solutions for Advent of Code will be placed in its own folder title by the year (ie. 2022). 
Inside the year folder, there will be a crate for each puzzle. Unless otherwise specified, they can all be executed by: `cargo run`
inside their respective directories.
