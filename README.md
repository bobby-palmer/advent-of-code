# My Advent of Code Solutions
This repo will track my solutions for every year of advent of code written in rust ðŸ¦€!  
# Purpose ðŸ“–
I plan to work on this in my spare time to become more familiar with Rust lang.  
# Status ðŸš¦
Currently working on completing the 2022 solutions. Then I intend to go back and cleanup / optimize the code.
Eventually I want to consolidate all the days solutions to one crate with each day in its own library module.
